# QT_Calculator_2024
This is a basic calculator app. 

I Started this project to familiarize myself with QT before applying to J.F. Taylor, so if you are from there, hello! 


Followed online tutorial to get foundation but have since improved upon that code and am working at add more functions to the calculator.
